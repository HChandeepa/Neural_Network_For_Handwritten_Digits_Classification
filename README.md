# Handwritten Digits Classification using Neural Networks

In this project, I build a neural network from scratch using TensorFlow and Python to classify handwritten digits. The project progresses from a simple model to a more complex architecture, allowing us to observe the impact of additional layers on model performance.

## Project Overview

### Initial Model:
We begin by building a basic neural network with only an input layer and an output layer. This model serves as a baseline for comparison.
Model Enhancement:
After evaluating the performance of the initial model, we add a hidden layer to the network. This allows us to analyze how the model's performance improves with the addition of more layers and complexity.
### Dataset
We use the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is readily available in TensorFlow and is commonly used for benchmarking classification algorithms.
